base.slvs			basic filemant holder, based on holders
				shipped with Kuttercraft (2017 model) printer

base -> left-ext.slvs		extension into 3D, left side
base -> right-ext.slvs		extension into 3D, right side (SolveSpace
				doesn't support mirroring yet, which is why we
				have to do this for each side
left-ext -> cut.slvs		hollowing-out of the support structure

left-ext, cut ->  left.slvs	final part, left side
right-ext, cut -> right.slvs	final part, right side

To generate basic STLs, "make stl"

To improve arcs, load left.slvs and right.slvs into SolveSpace and decrease
the export chord tolerance, then generate triangle mesh.
