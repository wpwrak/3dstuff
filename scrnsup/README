Support for the tiltable display of the Kuttercraft [1] 2017 3D
printer.

To change the tilt angle, change the height of both sides of the
vertical protrusion by the same amount.

This is my first design using Solvespace [2], and especially the
tangent arc feature was very useful for making all the nice
rounded corners.

The installed part (white) is shown on
